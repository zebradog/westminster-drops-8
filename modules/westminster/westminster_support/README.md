## Roadmap
- Provide meaningful defaults
- Allow uploading manual directly to (private?) filesystem
- Pipe contact form into a configurable endpoint (e.g. for submitting issues into an external ticketing system)
  - Configurable formats (possibly with a plugin system?) to support Dogtracks or other vendors
  - Add controller endpoint for submitting issues to dogtracks_issues module
